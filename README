xv6: A simple, Unix-like Teaching Operating System
==================================================

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6). xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

Notes to Self
-------------
- Install riscv-gnu-toolchain (64-bit) and qemu to tools/
- Add new programs you write to Makefile
- make qemu: to enter into xv6
- make qemu-gdb: to debug programs. Connect to the process from gdb in another shell
