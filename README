Assignment - 1
--------------

1. Create and demonstrate a user level program that prints the command line 
arguments.
For example,
                ╭─────────────────────────────────────╮
                │ $ myuser command1 command2 command3 │
                │ arg0 is myuser                      │
                │ arg1 is command1                    │
                │ arg2 is command2                    │
                │ arg3 is command3                    │
                ╰─────────────────────────────────────╯

2. Create and demonstrate a user level program that sleeps for x seconds.
   You would need to use the system call 'sleep'.
   An example output:
                        ╭───────────────────────╮
                        │ $ sleep 10            │
                        │ sleeping for 10 ticks │
                        ╰───────────────────────╯

*Important*, the line "sleeping for 10 ticks" should be printed from 
the kernel and not from your user program

3. Trace the execution of the sleep program, starting from the user mode
and going into the kernel, until the 'sleeping for 10 ticks' is printed.

4. Draw the memory map for the xv6 OS on qemu
